This (WIP and mostly untested!) mod adds the Autumn Journey cards to the Bella Sara PC game and also fixes Jewel's tail colour. 

To use this mod, add or replace the files with the same names which are in the same locations in the actual game files (which should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Codemasters on Windows).
In Windows, this may be done by dragging the CodeMasters folder to the same directory as the original and selecting replace all files.

Since game progress is saved separately (in C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Bella Sara), it should remain after applying the mod
