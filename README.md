## Additional Cards Mod

This mod adds the Autumn Journey cards to the Bella Sara PC game (and also fixes Jewel's tail colour). 

To use this mod, add or replace the original game files with the same names in the same (Codemasters) folder as is used here.
In Windows, this may be done by dragging the CodeMasters folder to the same folder as the original (which should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Codemasters) and selecting replace all files (not rename!).

Since game progress is saved separately (in C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Bella Sara), it should remain after applying the mod and also appears to keep working if the mod is removed. However, it would still be a good idea to save a backup just in case if you don't want to risk losing your progress.

## Texture Edits

This folder contains various texture edits which can be swapped with the original textures for different tack and horses.
