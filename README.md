This (WIP and mostly untested!) mod adds the Autumn Journey cards to the Bella Sara PC game and also fixes Jewel's tail colour. 

To use this mod, add or replace the original game files with the same names in the same foder as is used here.
In Windows, this may be done by dragging the CodeMasters folder to the same folder as the original (which should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Codemasters) and selecting replace all files.

Since game progress is saved separately (in C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Bella Sara), it should remain after applying the mod
