IDS_Intro1,Welcome to North of North!  My name is Freyja.  Let me show you around my Farm.
IDS_IntroHouse,This is the Farmhouse. You have your own room here where you can keep all your personal things.
IDS_IntroHouse2,You can use your room whenever you want to change your clothes or view your cards and awards.
IDS_IntroPaddock,The Paddock is where you will find your current horse that you are riding.
IDS_IntroPaddock2,"Here you can care for your horses. You can feed and groom them, or just give them a pat."
IDS_IntroStables,"The Stables are where our lovely Bella Sara horses live. There’s only 1 horse inside at the moment, but we have space for 4 more."
IDS_IntroStables2,"His name is Excelsior!  As you find new horses, you can choose them to go for a ride."
IDS_IntroFrontGate,This archway leads out to the horse riding trails. It’s fun to explore the trails with your horses.
IDS_IntroFrontGate2,You can also find useful and exciting things in them! Search the trails for scattered Horseshoes.
IDS_IntroFrontGate3,They’re what we use for money here. I bet you’ll find some Bella Sara cards in the trails too!
IDS_IntroFrontGate4,"You’ll find Bella Sara cards all over North of North. >Whenever you find some cards, I’ll present them to you when you return to the Farmyard. >Every card you find is added to your Card Collection, which you can inspect in your room here at the Farmhouse. >Some of these cards are especially important! >Those cards form Card Sets. >Complete a Card Set and a new horse will appear in the Stables! >You can check on progress with your latest Card Set too, here in your room."
IDS_IntroPaddockX,"After a ride, it’s always good to check on your horses in the Paddock."
IDS_IntroPaddockX2,Looking after your horse in the Paddock keeps your horses happy and healthy.
IDS_IntroPaddockX3,"If a horse is really tired after a ride, it will come back to the Paddock on its own."
IDS_IntroPaddockX4,"If this happens, visit the Paddock to care for the horse or choose another horse to ride from the Stables."
IDS_IntroNotice,The Noticeboard is where people from all around post notes if they want some help.
IDS_IntroNotice2,We also use it to announce special events and competitions.
IDS_IntroNotice3,It’s good to join in and help people with things. You are sure to be rewarded generously!
IDS_IntroShop,"Finnur, my husband, runs this shop. You can buy all sorts of things from him with your Pocket Money."
IDS_IntroShop2,"Inside you will find clothes, horse tack and grooming equipment."
IDS_IntroShopFin,Hello there!  I'm Finnur the shopkeeper.  Come see me whenever you need to make a purchase.  I'm always open!
IDS_IntroEnd,And that's my farm.  Go meet Excelsior in the paddock then take him out for a ride.
TutorialText_01,Hello. What a lovely day for a ride! Excelsior is a lovely horse. You will find that he is very gentle and trusting. Let me give you a few tips on how to look after him.
TutorialText_02,You can steer your horse by pressing left (A key) or right(D key). To control your horse's speed use forward(W) and back(S).
TutorialText_03,You can spur your horse on for a short burst of speed by pressing the SHIFT key. But be careful. This will tire your horse and they may need to have a rest.
TutorialText_04,"If you want to stop and have a break at any time, hit the ESC key to pause the game."
TutorialText_05,"When you approach a jump, use the SPACE bar to tell your horse to jump."
TutorialText_06,"As you ride your horse they will get tired and dirty. If your horse is too tired, you will have to take it back to the farm."
TutorialText_07,You can look after your horse back at Freyja's farm in the paddock. Groom and feed your horses so that they can be refreshed and ready to ride again.
TutorialText_08,There will be some areas that are blocked off by gates. As you find new horses you will be able to get through the gates and find new places to explore.
TutorialText_08a,"Look, what’s that up ahead? It’s a Bella Sara card!"
TutorialText_08b,"Quick, pick it up!"
TutorialText_09,When you return to the farm you can see what cards you have collected on your ride.
TutorialText_10,"These are horse-shoes. You can buy things with them in Finnur's shop, so collect as many of them as you can."
TutorialText_11,"You can go back to the farm whenever you like by riding to the gates, or travel back to the farm instantly by choosing the Return to Farm option on the pause menu."
